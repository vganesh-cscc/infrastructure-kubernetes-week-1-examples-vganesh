## Ganesh notes 



$ **kubectl describe --help** 

Show details of a specific resource or group of resources.

**kubectl describe TYPE NAME_PREFIX**

Valid values for **TYPE** are resources like pods, deployments and many more listed below. 

Use "kubectl api-resources" for a complete list of supported resources.

Example resources are namespaces, nodes, pods, secrets, services, deployments, replicasets, cronjobs, jobs, ingresses, roles, storageclasses and volumeattachments to name a few. 

There are about 55 resources listed when I run the command below. 

$ **kubectl api-resources | wc -l**

56


What is a **namespace** in Kubernetes?

**Namespaces** are a way to organize clusters â€” they can be helpful when different teams share a Kubernetes cluster. Any number of namespaces are supported within a cluster, each logically separated from others but with the ability to communicate with each other.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/

Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace. 

Namespace-based scoping is applicable only for namespaced objects (e.g. Deployments, Services, etc) and not for cluster-wide objects (e.g. StorageClass, Nodes, PersistentVolumes, etc)


Q: What does it mean if a namespace is going to communicate with another namespace? When does it happen? Examples??? 



What is a Kubernetes **cluster**  ? 

A Kubernetes **cluster** is a set of nodes that run containerized applications. Cluster is a bunch of machines. 


https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/kubernetes-cluster.html#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Kubernetes%20cluster,and%20flexible%20than%20virtual%20machines.


https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/

A **node** may be a virtual or physical machine. 


$ **kubectl get nodes**

NAME       STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION

minikube   Ready    control-plane   16h   v1.26.1


In this example think of minikube to be the CentOS VM where minikube software was installed. 

When minikube was installed on CentOS VM, the following file is created. The name of the cluster in the config file is minikube, a single node cluster. 

**ls -ltr   ~/.kube/config**

-rw-------. 1 vganesh docker 932 Mar 25 22:10 /home/CSCC/vganesh/.kube/config

$ **grep cluster ~/.kube/config**
clusters:
- cluster:
  name: cluster_info
  cluster: minikube
  cluster: minikube



At my work place, the environment variable KUBECONFIG points to a test configuration yaml file that was created for test purpose. 

The name of the cluster is **test011** and it has about twenty nodes, meaning twenty different machines with different ip addresses. These nodes are running on AWS cloud environment. 

C:\Users\ganesv2

**set | findstr yaml**

KUBECONFIG=C:\Users\ganesv2\.kube\config_test.yaml


$ **kubectl get nodes | wc -l**
21


C:\Users\ganesv2

**findstr cluster .kube\config_test.yaml**

clusters:
  cluster: docker-desktop
  cluster: test011
  cluster: test011-fqdn
